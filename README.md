Karniadakis. “Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems Involving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations.” Journal of Computational Physics 378 (February 1, 2019): 686–707. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045.

Tests:
- test.py: basic test. Paramters of the equation are unknown but taken to be
  cosntants.
- test_func.py: Same as test but one parameter now depends on x_2
